          Virex started with a simple observation: deploying applications shouldn't be hard. Yet developers everywhere were spending hours configuring CI/CD pipelines, managing infrastructure, and debugging deployment issues.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-4 text-lg text-text-muted leading-relaxed">
          We founded Virex in 2021 to change that. Our mission is to make deployment so simple that it disappears—letting developers focus entirely on building great products.
